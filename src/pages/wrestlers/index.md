**What you gonna do, brother? What you gonna do when Hulkamania runs wild on you?**

**JS Framework:** Angular (Version 7)<br>
**CSS Framework:** Ng-Bootstrap<br>
**External Dependencies:** [http://www.coneysloft.com](http://www.coneysloft.com/magazine/2016/7/4/the-top-50-wrestlers-of-wwfs-golden-era-1985-1992) *- Wrestler write ups*

**This app is doing the following:**

- Retrieving a JSON object array via a service
- Displaying the data inside the JSON array on the front end
- Using (click) and NgClass to do some funky interactive filtering on the front end
- Taking the user into a single view of the entry they clicked by filtering the - JSON object array within the sectionâ€™s component


**Purpose of demo:** Demonstrate a few different methods of filtering.
