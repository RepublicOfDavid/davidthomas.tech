**I kept dreaming of a world I thought I'd never see. And then one day, I got in.**

**JS Framework:** AngularJS<br>
**External Dependencies:** [https://reqres.in/](https://reqres.in/) *- Mock API*

**This app is doing the following:**

- Posting an email address and password to a RESTful API (Mock)
- If post credentials are correct an access token is returned and the user can access the site
- Calling another (Mock) RESTful API to display a list of staff


**Purpose of demo:** Demonstrate posting to and calling to an API.

**Login**
To demo the site you'll need the credentials:
Email: eve.holt@reqres.in
Password: cityslicka
